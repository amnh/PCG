# How to use the PCG documentation
---

We have broken our documentation into four parts, as explained in the [*"What nobody tells you about documentation"*](https://documentation.divio.com/) presentation.



## Tutorials

**Location:** [`doc/tutorials`](https://github.com/amnh/PCG/tree/master/doc/tutorials)

Tutorials are lessons that take the you by the hand through a series of steps to complete a task with PCG. They exist in order to show a beginner that they can achieve something simple with PCG.

These are wholly learning-oriented, and specifically, they are oriented towards learning how rather than learning that.



## How-to Guides

**Location:** [`doc/how-tos`](https://github.com/amnh/PCG/tree/master/doc/how-tos)

How-to guides take the you through the steps required to solve a real-world problem with PCG.

They are recipes, directions to achieve a specific end - for example: how to create a new character type; how to create a new command; how to perform a new tree search operation.

They are wholly goal-oriented.

How-to guides are wholly distinct from tutorials and must not be confused with them:

  - A tutorial shows a beginner what they need to know.
  - A how-to guide is an answer to a question that only a user with some experience could even formulate.


## Architecture

**Location:** [`doc/architecture`](https://github.com/amnh/PCG/tree/master/doc/architecture)

Explanations which clarify and illuminate the decisions and organization of PCG as a project.


## Haddock Technical Reference

**Location:** [`doc/haddock`](https://github.com/amnh/PCG/tree/master/doc/haddock)

The automatically generated [Haddock](https://www.haskell.org/haddock/) documentation serves as a comprehensive technical reference for all the internal functions which make up PCG.

For more information on building the Haddock documentation, see the ["Installation" tutorial](https://github.com/amnh/PCG/blob/master/doc/tutorials/Installation.md).
