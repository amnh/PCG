\section{Introduction}
Rerooting is the method of considering every edge in a rooted tree to be the potential root, determining the cost and character states for the tree if that edge was selected as the root. A precondition is that a postorder scoring of the tree has already occurred with an arbitrary edge in the unrooted tree selected as the root.
