-- Standard Additive character analysis (cost and medians).
--
-- This only works on static characters, and due to the traversal, only one
-- character will be received at a time.
--
-- Assumes binary trees.
--
-- Note that this is the same procedure as for continuous characters, but with
-- costs of Word, not Double.
