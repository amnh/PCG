-- The various ways in which writing output data from PCG can fail.
--
-- A single file can fail at outputting data in multiple ways, /sometimes simultaneously/.
-- To account for this the 'OutputStreamError' type is a composable 'Semigroup' to allow
-- for the collection of many possible outputting errors to be coalesced into a single
-- 'OutputStreamError' value.
--
-- The 'TextShow' instance should be used to render the 'OutputStreamError' as a human legible
-- collection of output errors that occurred while attempting to output data from PCG.
--
-- The 'Show' instance should only be used for debugging purposes.
