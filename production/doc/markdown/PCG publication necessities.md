### Publication priorities

Dependencies for all:
* code
* output of descriptive information

1. **Network optimization**
    * Dependencies:
        * Data structure tests
            * \\(\frac{1}{3}\\) are obvious
            * other straightforward stuff (but what?)
            * integration testing (easier with graph interface)

1. **IA**

    * GPU stuff?

1. **Software description**

1. **Trajectory stuff (edits on networks)**
    * depends on SPR, TBR

1. **Single cost (pre-order, post-order for networks)**

    * need this code locked down
        * `Maybe`s <span style="color: teal">might be hard</span>
        * verify single assignment
        * display trees for individual blocks or characters <span style="color: teal">might be hard</span>

1. **Various empirical cases**
    * co-phylogenies
    * horizontal gene transfer
    * hybridization
    * hybridization on languages
