-- Takes two decorations in, a child and a parent, and calculates the median
-- character value of the child. For each possible character state this value is
-- based on whether that character state in the child is on one of the min-cost
-- paths from the root to the leaves. It relies on dynamic programming to do so,
-- using the minimum tuple in the parent to determine whether that character
-- state can participate in the final median. Using the left child as a template,
-- the character state is part of the median if, for some state in the parent,
--
-- parCharState_characterCost_left == childCharState_characterCost + TCM(parCharState, childCharState).
