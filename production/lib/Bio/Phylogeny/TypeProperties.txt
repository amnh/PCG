Trees:
    Rose: 
        - the node returned by parent should not be in children
        - the node returned by parent should be in those returned by parents

    Binary:
        - left and right children should be distinct
        - bothChildren and separate left and right child methods should agree

    Network: 
        - parents and children should not have any common nodes
        - after update, a tree should be the same size as before
        - the node returned by root should satisfy isRoot
        - after setters are applied, should get new value back

    Nodes:
        Encoded: 
            - after setting, should return new value

        Preliminary:
            - after setters, new value should be returned
            - preliminaryAlign should be the same length or longer than preliminary
            - cost should be positive

        Character:
            - after setter, new value returned

        Final:
            - after setter, new value returned

        Packed:
            - after setter, new value returned
            - if combined with encoded, packed sequence should be same length or shorter

        EdgeAware:
            - after setter, new value returned
            - at least one edge is returned from edges

    Edges:
        Standard:
            - origin and terminal should return different nodes
            - connection should agree with (origin, terminal)
            - after setter is applied, should get new value back

Sequence:
    Parsed:
        - encode should return a structure of corresponding length

    Single:
        - checkAmbiguous should always return False
