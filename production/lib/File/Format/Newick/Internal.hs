{----
  - The Newick file format was developed by an informal committee meeting at
  - Newick's seafood restaurant. The grammar definition of the Newick format
  - was never formally specified, but Gary Olsen's interpretation of the 
  - original newick format has been documented here: 
  - http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/newick_doc.html
  - 
  - After over two decades of informal usage, the Extended Newick file format
  - was proposed in a BCM publication which allowed node labels to be non-
  - unique and merged to a single node with shared ancestors and descendants.
  - This allowed for easy manual annotating of phylogentic trees.
  -
  - Another half decade later, the Forest Extended Newick was proposed by
  - Professor Wheeler to model collections of disjoint phylogenetic trees.
  - This new format allowed grouping many Extended Newick trees into a 
  - forest to be analyzed collectively.
  -
  - This parser correctly parses both Newick file formats, and the super set
  - Extended Newick filed format.
