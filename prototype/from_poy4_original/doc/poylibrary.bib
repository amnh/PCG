  abstract = {Bats are an important component of tropical faunas, both in terms
	of number of species and total biomass. Very little information,
	however, is available on the status and conservation of this diverse
	group. To contribute to the solution of this problem, rarity among
	Neotropical bats was analyzed using a set of 150 species. Rarity
	was quantified by local abundance and area of distributional range
	and by a combined index of rarity created by compounding these two
	variables. Nested analyses of variance showed local abundance to
	be more variable among genera than at any other taxonomic level,
	and area of distribution to be more variable among species. No significant
	correlation with body mass was found for local abundance or for area
	of distribution. Similarly, no correlation was found between distribution
	and abundance. Local abundance, but not area of distribution, varied
	significantly among taxonomic and trophic categories. At the local
	level, bats of the family Molossidae tend to be less abundant than
	other species. Bats that feed on plant parts or products (fruit,
	nectar, and pollen) are more abundant than insectivores and carnivores.
	The distribution of species among Rabinowitz' categories of rarity
	varied among taxonomic and trophic groups. The classification of
	rarity and the combined index of rarity introduced here can be used
	as guidelines for the identification of vulnerable species.},

	upon the Plateau of the Devon Island in analogous landscapes of Palaearctic
	is very similar and there are many common features determining specificity
	of soil communities formed in these regions: depauperated local faunas
	(which partially consist of the same species in almost all Polar
	desert regions), absolute predominance of the typical arctic species
	belonging to only 3 families (Hypogastruridae, Isotomidae, and Onychiuridae),
	high densities of Collembola (much higher than in natural communities
	of the humid zone including tundras) etc. Nevertheless, there is
	similarity in some features of the Collembola populations from the
	Plateau and of those from the more southern Arctic tundra subzone.
	This similarity, probably, is due to the fact that the Plateau communities
	are extrazonal. Some of these features can be nothing but regional
	peculiarities of the Canadian High Arctic, but the low densities
	or even complete absence of some typical arctic forms and the lower
	relative numbers of Collembola as compared to those of some groups
	of Acari are believed to be explained by the extrazonal type of the
	Plateau landscapes. [References: 20]},

  abstract = {In this paper we propose a reappraisal of the relationships between
	the basal hexapod lineages (the former 'apterygote' insects) and
	the other major groups of mandibulate arthropods. It results from
	a cladistic analysis including 72 characters based on external morphology,
	internal anatomy and development. Detailed comments are provided
	on the various characters used and the scoring of their states. The
	35 terminal taxa include 12 hexapods (9 of which are basal 'apterygote'
	representatives), 7 myriapods, 13 crustaceans, and 3 chelicerates
	taken as outgroups. The results of our analyses are discussed in
	detail for each of the taxonomic groupings, and compared with those
	recently obtained by other authors using different approaches based
	on morphological, palaeontological, developmental or molecular sequence
	data. Our results support the monophyly of the Mandibulata, Crustacea,
	Atelocerata (Tracheata) and Hexapoda, but the assemblage of Myriapoda
	appears poorly supported. A close relationship between Crustacea
	and Hexapoda, as hypothesized by several authors, is not found in
	any of our analyses. Within Hexapoda, the Protura and the Collembola
	appear as independent clades, whereas the two unresolved dipluran
	taxa are grouped with the monophyletic Ectognatha (Archaeognatha,
	Zygentoma and Pterygota).},

	Helobdella robusta (Annelida: Hirudinida), and Galathealinum brachiosum
	(Pogonophora: Perviata). The relative arrangements of all 22 genes
	identified for Helobdella and Galathealinum are identical to one
	another and to their arrangements in the mtDNA of the previously
	studied oligochaete annelid Lumbricus. In contrast, Platynereis differs
	from these taxa in the positions of several tRNA genes and in having
	two additional tRNA genes (trnC and trnM) and a large noncoding sequence
	in this region. Comparisons of relative gene arrangements and of
	the nucleotide and inferred amino acid sequences among these and
	other published taxa provide strong support for an annelid-mollusk
	clade that excludes arthropods, and for the inclusion of pogonophorans
	within Annelida, rather than giving them separate phylum status.
	Gene arrangement comparisons include the first use of a recently
	described method on previously unpublished data. Although a variety
	of alternative initiation codons are typically used by mitochondrial
	protein-encoding genes, ATG appears to be the initiator for all but
	one reported here. The large noncoding region (1,091 nt) identified
	in Platynereis has no significant sequence similarity to the noncoding
	region of Lumbricus, although each contains runs of TA dinucleotides
	and of homopolymers, which could potentially serve as signaling elements.
	There is strong bias for synonymous codon usage in Helobdella and
	especially in Galathealinum. In this latter taxon, 5 codons are completely
	unused, 13 are used three or fewer times, and G appears at third
	codon positions in only 26 of the 2,236 codons. Nucleotide composition
	bias appears to influence amino acid composition of the proteins.},

	the paraphyly of Chelonia mydas with respect to Chelonia agassizi,

	that mitochondrial DNA in marine turtles evolves much more slowly

	substitution rate to generation length and metabolic pace. [References:

  abstract = {Arthropod hemocyanins are members of a protein superfamily that also
	comprises the arthropod phenoloxidases (tyrosinases), crustacean
	pseudohemocyanins (cryptocyanins), and insect storage hexamerins.
	The evolution of these proteins was inferred by neighbor-joining,
	maximum-parsimony, and maximum-likelihood methods. Monte Carlo shuffling
	approaches provided evidence against a discernible relationship of
	the arthropod hemocyanin superfamily and molluscan hemocyanins or
	nonarthropodan tyrosinases. Within the arthropod hemocyanin superfamily,
	the phenoloxidase probably emerged early in the (eu-)arthropod stemline
	and thus form the most likely outgroup. The respiratory hemocyanins
	evolved from these enzymes before the radiation of the extant euarthropodan
	subphyla. Due to different functional constraints, replacement rates
	greatly vary between the clades. Divergence times were thus estimated
	assuming local molecular clocks using several substitution models.
	The results were consistent and indicated the separation of the cheliceratan
	and crustacean hemocyanins close to 600 MYA. The different subunit
	types of the multihexameric cheliceratan hemocyanin have a rather
	conservative structure and diversified in the arachnidan stemline
	between 550 and 450 MYA. By contrast, the separation of the crustacean
	(malacostracan) hemocyanin subunits probably occurred only about
	200 MYA. The nonrespiratory pseudohemocyanins evolved within the
	Decapoda about 215 MYA. The insect hemocyanins and storage hexamerins
	emerged independently from the crustacean hemocyanins. The time of
	divergence of the insect proteins from the malacostracan hemocyanins
	was estimated to be about 430-440 MYA, providing support for the
	notion that the Hexapoda evolved from the same crustacean lineage
	as the Malacostraca.},

	Advances in methods of data generation and analysis have led to the

	advances, we have compiled information on the taxa and regions sequenced
	from all available phylogenetic studies of insects. It is evident
	that investigators have not usually coordinated their efforts. The
	genes and regions that have been sequenced differ substantially among
	studies and the whole of our efforts is thus little greater than
	the sum of its parts. The cytochrome oxidase I, 16S, 18S, and elongation
	factor-1{alpha} genes have been widely used and are informative across
	a broad range of divergences in insects. We advocate their use as
	standards for insect phylogenetics. Insect molecular systematics
	has complemented and enhanced the value of morphological and ecological
	data, making substantial contributions to evolutionary biology in
	the process. A more coordinated approach focused on gathering homologous
	sequence data will greatly facilitate such efforts.},

	were collected for 31 species and small nuclear ribonucleic acid
	U2 data for 29 species. The sequences provided a total of 460 sites
	and 192 parsimony-informative characters. H3 analyses showed substantial
	codon usage bias, but had a low consistency index (0.26). Consistency
	indices were higher for the U2 data (0.49), suggesting that the class
	of snRNAs may provide several phylogenetically useful genes. The
	present data are not by themselves sufficient to clarify major arthropod
	group relationships. Partitioned data for H3 and U2 are incongruent
	according to Incongruence Length Difference tests. Although the most
	parsimonious trees, based on combined analyses of all taxa, differ
	substantially from morphology-based trees, anomalous groupings are
	weakly supported with only one exception. The trees uphold monophyly
	of Onychophora, Branchiopoda, and Malacostraca (rather than the rival
	Phyllopoda). Cladistic analyses constraining the monophyly of morphologically
	defined classes do not significantly distinguish between the main
	rival hypotheses of major clade relationships. Combined (?spliced?)
	analysis of both genes improves topological congruence with morphological
	groupings relative to that of either partition. Character congruence
	between H3, U2, and morphology is increased by downweighting (but
	not excluding) transitions and third codons. Analyses of four-taxon
	statements using PHYLTEST found significant support for the basal
	position of the Crustacea among the euarthropods. This support may
	be due to the similarity of chelicerates, myriapods and hexapods

	the first complete mitochondrial genome sequences of any extinct
	taxa--two New Zealand moa genera--along with a 1,000-base-pair sequence

	also generated 12 kilobases of contiguous sequence from the kiwi,
	cassowary, emu and two tinamou genera. This large dataset allows
	statistically precise estimates of molecular divergence dates and
	these support a Late Cretaceous vicariant speciation of ratite taxa,
	followed by the subsequent dispersal of the kiwi to New Zealand.
	This first molecular view of the break-up of Gondwana provides a
	new temporal framework for speciation events within other Gondwanan
	biota and can be used to evaluate competing biogeographical hypotheses.},

	a new example of a postzygotic sex-determination system in two collembolan
	species, Bourletiella arvalis and B. hortensis. In B. arvalis, where
	chromosome number could be assessed, both sexes are homogametic (n=6)
	and all zygotes have an identical chromosome composition (2n=12).
	However, male embryos develop after the loss of two sex chromosomes,
	making the male genotype 2n=10 (4AAX10X20). On the other hand, female
	embryos develop if the zygote retains all chromosomes and the female
	genetic system is, therefore, 4AAX1X1X2X2 (2n=12). As an apparent
	consequence of the lack of two chromosomes in the male germ cells,
	spermatogenesis is aberrant. At the first meiotic division, in fact,
	the two resulting secondary spermatocytes receive a different number
	of chromosomes: six and four. The cells which receive six chromosomes
	(one haploid set of four autosomes and two sex chromosomes) proceed
	through the meiotic process and the two spermatids generated produce
	two spermatozoa by a normal spermiogenesis. The cells receiving only
	four chromosomes do not undergo the second meiotic division and soon
	degenerate. The degenerating cells can be considered a morphological
	marker for this process, as they are easily recognizable at the electron
	microscope from the functional secondary spermatocytes by the appearance
	of the nucleus (totally condensed), the reduction of the cytoplasm
	(limited to a thin layer surrounding the nucleus), and the lack of
	most cytoplasmic organelles with the exception of a couple of centrioles).
	Electron microscopic evidence has been collected for both species,
	allowing to extend the same process to B. hortensis, even if chromosomes
	could not be counted in this species. Therefore, as a result of the
	spermatocyte elimination, the efficiency of spermatogenesis is reduced
	to 50%. This process is identical to that observed in other collembolan
	species of the suborder Symphypleona, and it is suggested that it
	represents a synapomorphic feature uniting the families Dicyrtomidae,
	Sminthuridae and Bourletiellidae (Sminthuriformia). It is also suggested
	that the process is related with the finding of a distorted sex ratio
	in natural populations and, possibly, with the evolution of parthenogenesis.
	This hypothesis is supported by the fact that chromosome pairing
	and genetic recombination occurs only during female meiosis, while
	chromosomes do not pair during male meiosis.},

	two sexes differ for the lack of two chromosomes (the sex chromosomes)
	in males (males, 2n = 10; females, 2n = 12). While oogenesis seems
	to proceed normally, spermatogenesis is peculiar because the two
	daughter cells of the first meiotic division have different chromosome
	numbers (six and four). The cell receiving four chromosomes degenerates,
	while the cell receiving six chromosomes completes meiosis and produces
	identical spermatozoa (n = 6). At fertilization, pronuclei with six
	chromosomes fuse together to form zygotes with 2n = 12. Male embryos
	must lose two sex chromosomes during the first zygotic mitosis, as
	all male cells have 2n = 10 chromosomes. The sex chromosome system
	of these species can be identified as X1X1X2X2:X1X20. Electron microscopy
	observations show that the same peculiar spermatogenesis occurs also
	in two others species of the same family, Caprainea marginata and
	Lipothrix lubbocki. The peculiar sex determination system described
	is similar but not identical to what is observed in other insect
	orders, and it may represent an evolutionary step toward parthenogenesis.
	It is suggested that this peculiar spermatogenesis is common to all
	Symphypleona.},

	the male embryo. At the end of the first meiotic division of spermatogenesis,
	a second chromosome elimination occurs, allowing half the secondary
	spermatocytes, later transformed into spermatids, to receive a complete
	haploid set of chromosomes. The secondary spermatocytes, which receive
	an incomplete set of chromosomes, degenerate. Males of the two collembolan
	species, therefore, produce a reduced number (50%) of spermatozoa.
	Females of D. ornata have 2n = 12 and males 2n = 10 chromosomes;
	females of P. italica have 2n = 14 and males 2n = 12 chromosomes.
	In both species, oogenesis proceeds normally and chromosomes pair
	and form chiasmata in meiotic prophase. The adaptive significance
	of this post-zygotic mechanism of sex determination is discussed.
	The mechanism seems to be a characteristic feature of the suborder
	Symphypleona. The neanurid Arthropleona Anurida maritima (Gu\'erin),
	which was studied for comparative analysis, has 2n = 8 chromosomes
	and normal spermatogenesis producing haploid nuclei with four chromosomes.

	regions (stems) and non-base-pairing regions (loops) contain phylogenetic
	information, as judged by the level of support of the phylogenetic
	results compared with a well-established tree based on both morphological
	and molecular data. The best results (the greatest level of support
	of well-accepted nodes) were obtained when the complete data set
	was used. However, some previously supported nodes were resolved
	using either the stem or loop bases alone. Stem bases sustain a greater
	number of compensatory mutations than would be expected at random,
	but the number is < 40% of that expected under a hypothesis of perfect
	compensation to maintain secondary structure. Therefore, we suggest
	that in phylogenetic analyses, the weighting of stem characters be
	reduced by no more than 20%, relative to that of loop characters.
	In contrast to previous suggestions, we do not recommend weighting
	of stem positions by one-half, compared with that of loop positions,
	because this overcompensates for the constraints that selection imposes
	on the secondary structure of rRNA.},

  abstract = {Taxonomic congruence and total evidence are competing paradigms in
	phylogenetic inference. Taxonomic congruence focuses on deriving
	a consensus from the results obtained from separately analyzed data
	sets, whereas total evidence uses character congruence in the search
	for the best-fitting hypothesis for all of the available character
	evidence. Explicit or implicit use of taxonomic congruence is usually
	employed when an investigator either has both molecular and morphological
	data sets or has different gene-, rRNA-, or protein-sequence data
	sets available. Indeed, a taxonomic congruence rationale is frequently
	used as the basis for exploring classes of data, thus allowing comparison
	between the phylogenetic signal emerging from a particular data set
	and those of other such classes. Problematic aspects of employing
	the taxonomic congruence approach include the potentially misleading
	and arbitrary choices of both a consensus method and the division
	of characters into subsets. If the goal of an analysis is to provide
	the best estimate of genealogy afforded by the available character
	evidence, then taxonomic congruence is substantially more arbitrary
	than a total evidence approach. The theoretical advantages of phylogenetic
	estimates based on total evidence are argued in the present study
	and are illustrated with an example of amniote relationships. We
	report conflicting results from total evidence and taxonomic congruence
	approaches, with analyses of previously reported data from both fossil
	and living amniotes and from bath morphology and molecules, the latter
	including available 18S rRNA, 28S rRNA, and protein sequences. We
	conclude that a more highly resolved and robust phylogenetic hypothesis
	of amniotes, the traditional one, emerges when a total evidence approach

  abstract = {Insects are the most diverse lineage of all life in numbers of species,
	and ecologically they dominate terrestrial ecosystems. However, how
	and when this immense radiation of animals originated is unclear.
	Only a few fossils provide insight into the earliest stages of insect
	evolution, and among them are specimens in chert from Rhynie, Scotland's
	Old Red Sandstone (Pragian; about 396?407 million years ago1), which
	is only slightly younger than formations harbouring the earliest
	terrestrial faunas. The most well-known animal from Rhynie is the
	springtail Rhyniella praecursor (Entognatha; Collembola), long considered
	to be the oldest hexapod2,3. For true insects (Ectognatha), the oldest
	records are two apparent wingless insects from later in the Devonian
	period of North America4,5. Here we show, however, that a fragmentar
	y fossil from Rhynie, Rhyniognatha hirsti, is not only the earliest
	true insect but may be relatively derived within basal Ectognatha.
	In fact, Rhyniognatha has derived characters shared with winged insects,
	suggesting that the origin of wings may have been earlier than prev
	iously believed. Regardless, Rhyniognatha indicates that insects
	originated in the Silurian period and were members of some of the
	earliest terrestrial faunas. },

	is easy to maintain in the laboratory on a diet of granulated dry
	yeast. F. candida has been used as a "standard" test organism for
	more than 40 years for estimating the effects of pesticides and environmental
	pollutants on nontarget soil arthropods. However, it has also been
	employed as a model for the investigation of numerous other phenomena
	such as cold tolerance, quality as a prey item, and effects of microarthropod
	grazing on pathogenic fungi and mycorrhizae of plant roots. In this
	comprehensive review, aspects of the life history, ecology, and ecotoxicology
	of F. candida are covered. We focus on the recent literature, especially
	studies that have examined the effects of soil pollutants on reproduction
	in F. candida using the protocol published by the International Standards

	plants of its congeners},
  journal = {Evolution},
  year = {1993},
  volume = {47},
  pages = {888-905},
  number = {3},
  abstract = {We ask whether patterns of genetic variation in a phytophagous insect's
	responses to potential host plants shed light on the phylogenetic
	history of host association. Ophraella communa feeds chiefly, and
	in eastern North America exclusively, on Ambrosia (Asteraceae: Ambrosiinae).
	Using mostly half-sib breeding designs, we screened for genetic variation
	in feeding responses to and larval survival on its own host and on
	seven other plants that are hosts (or, on one case, closely related
	to the host) of other species of Ophraella. We found evidence for
	genetic variation in feeding responses to five of the seven test
	plants, other than the natural host. We found no evidence of genetic
	variation in feeding responses to two plant species, nor in capacity
	for larval survival on six. These results imply constraints on the
	availability of genetic variation; however, little evidence for constraints
	in the form of negative genetic correlations was found. These results
	are interpreted in the context of a provisional phylogeny of, and
	a history of host shifts within, the genus. Ophraella communa does
	not present evidence of genetic variation in its ability to feed
	and/or survive on Solidago, even though it is probably descended
	from a lineage that fed on Solidago or related plants, possibly as
	recently as 1.9 million years ago. Genetic variation in performance
	on this plant may have been lost. Based on evidence for genetic variation
	and on mean performance, by far the greatest potentiality for adaptation
	to a congener's host was evinced in responses to Iva frutescens,
	which not only is related and chemically similar to Ambrosia, but
	also is the host of a closely related species of Ophraella that may
	have been derived from an Ambrosia-associated ancestor. Genetic variation
	in O. communa's capacity to feed and/or survive on its congeners'
	hosts is less evident for plants that do not represent historically
	realized host shifts (with one exception) than for those that may
	(but see Note Added in Proof). The results offer some support for
	the hypothesis that the evolution of host shifts has been guided
	in part by constrained genetic variation. [References: 65]},

	whereas most suboptimal parameter sets group Tricholepidion with
	Zygentoma. Stable hypotheses include the monophyly of Diplura, and
	a sister group relationship between Diplura and Protura, contradicting

	species, presents conspicuous differentiation of both ribosomal genes
	(sequenced fragments of 12S and 16S) and chemical blends from tergal
	glands (proportions of linalyl acetate and the alcohol 4, 6, 8-trimethyl-7,
	9- undecadien-5-ol, compounds previously identified in females originating
	from North America). A phylogenetic reconstruction involving Blatta
	orientalis as an outgroup, Therea petiveriana as a polyphagid relative,
	C. kyebangensis and 17 North American Cryptocercus populations showed
	that C. kyebangensis stands as a sister-group of North American Cryptocercus,
	thus suggesting that one beringian vicariance has taken place in
	the early differentiation of the genus. Using sequence divergences
	within the framework of the molecular clock leads to comparable datation
	estimates for both ribosomal genes, ranging between Miocene and Pliocene
	for the whole history of the genus Cryptocercus, therefore congruent
	with previous phylogenetic biogeographical estimates. This new set
	of data for this East Asian species supports heterobathmy in the
	genus Cryptocercus and argues against the misleading primitive taxon
	concept. SPECIES NOVA: Cryptocercus kyebangensis Grandcolas.},

	study (431 443 bp phyfrom 12S rRNA gene) has been reanalyzed by using:
	(1) interthe published alignment, (2) the alignment actually used
	by the author, (3) another alignment based on a cladistic procedure,

	The original tree was not retrieved using the analysis parameters

	depending on changes in alignment and in outgroup or on an reconincrease
	in the taxon sample size. It is concluded that this DNA data set
	alone cannot be used currently to draw a robust phylogenetic hypothesis.
	This data set should congrube expanded or combined in a more general
	phylogenetic analysis using all other available data sets. Therefore,
	the results from other recent analyses, both morphologi- cal and
	molecular, which placed the well-known subso- cial woodroach Cryptocercus

	years ago. Followed soon after by fungi and lichens, the microbial
	and algal sludge would have provided the basis for the development
	of more complex soils. The cyanobacterial and algal mats probably
	dominated life on land in the Precambrian and Early Paleozoic for
	many millions of years. The next step, the evolution of land plants,
	was evidently a difficult transition. On land, plants not only need
	the means to acquire and retain water but must also protect themselves
	against large doses of ultraviolet radiation. It is widely believed
	that some form of aquatic or terrestrial green alga was the progenitor
	of the two great classes of modern land plants, the bryophytes and
	the tracheophytes. Three lineages--liverworts, hornworts and mosses--comprise
	the bryophytes, commonly referred to as ``nonvascular'' plants. Tracheophytes,
	commonly referred to as ``vascular'' plants, include lycopods, horsetails,
	ferns, and seed plants. Such a diversity of plant life was an important
	antecedent to the invasion of land by animals. Microscopic fragments
	of an animal's bristle provide evidence that the continents were
	inhabited 430 million years ago. Bristles and cuticles removed from
	rocks deposited in the Early Silurian period suggest that some arthropod-like
	animals may have lived on the continents about 30 million years earlier
	than previously thought. The oldest indisputable terrestrial arthropods
	are found in Late Silurian deposits (about 415 million years old).
	Finally, the tetrapod vertebrates, which along with insects dominate
	today's terrestrial communities, appear only late in the Devonian,
	about 365 million years ago. Vertebrates remained dependent on insects,
	fish, and each other for sustenance almost up to the end of the Carboniferous
	period, about 280 million years ago. At that time a few reptiles
	and amphibians show adaptations--peg-like teeth and barrel-shaped
	bodies-- suggestive of a plant diet. The critical adaptation, however,
	was probably the formation of symbiotic relationships with microorganisms
	that could digest and detoxify vascular plant matter.},

	During the evolution of vertebrates, insertion or deletion of new
	sequence tracts preferentially takes place in the subareas of D domains
	where the more recently fixed insertions/deletions were located in

  abstract = {Bootstrapping is a common method for assessing confidence in phylogenetic
	analyses. Although bootstrapping was first applied in phylogenetics
	to assess the repeatability of a given result, bootstrap results
	are commonly interpreted as a measure of the probability that a phylogenetic
	estimate represents the true phylogeny. Here we use computer simulations
	and a laboratory-generated phylogeny to test bootstrapping results
	of parsimony analyses, both as measures of repeatability (i.e., the
	probability of repeating a result given a new sample of characters)
	and accuracy (i.e., the probability that a result represents the
	true phylogeny). Our results indicate that any given bootstrap proportion
	provides an unbiased but highly imprecise measure of repeatability,
	unless the actual probability of replicating the relevant result
	is nearly one. The imprecision of the estimate is great enough to
	render the estimate virtually useless as a measure of repeatability.
	Under conditions thought to be typical of most phylogenetic analyses,
	however, bootstrap proportions in majority-rule consensus trees provide
	biased but highly conservative estimates of the probability of correctly
	inferring the corresponding clades. Specifically, under conditions
	of equal rates of change, symmetric phylogenies, and internodal change
	of less-than-or-equal-to 20% of the characters, bootstrap proportions
	of greater-than-or-equal-to 70% usually correspond to a probability
	of greater-than-or-equal-to 95% that the corresponding clade is real.
	However, under conditions of very high rates of internodal change
	(approaching randomization of the characters among taxa) or highly
	unequal rates of change among taxa, bootstrap proportions >50% are
	overestimates of accuracy. [References: 19]},

  abstract = {The success of 16 methods of phylogenetic inference was examined using
	consistency and simulation analysis. Success-the frequency with which
	a tree-making method correctly identified the true phylogeny-was
	examined for an unrooted four-taxon tree. In this study, tree-making
	methods were examined under a large number of branch-length conditions
	and under three models of sequence evolution. The results are plotted
	to facilitate comparisons among the methods. The consistency analysis
	indicated which methods converge on the correct tree given infinite
	sample size. General parsimony, transversion parsimony, and weighted
	parsimony are inconsistent over portions of the graph space examined,
	although the area of inconsistency varied. Lake's method of invariants
	consistently estimated phylogeny over all of the graph space when
	the model of sequence evolution matched the assumptions of the invariants
	method. However, when one of the assumptions of the invariants method
	was violated, Lake's method of invariants became inconsistent over
	a large portion of the graph space. In general, the distance methods
	(neighbor joining, weighted least squares, and unweighted least squares)
	consistently estimated phylogeny over all of the graph space examined
	when the assumptions of the distance correction matched the model
	of evolution used to generate the model trees. When the assumptions
	of the distance methods were violated, the methods became inconsistent
	over portions of the graph space. UPGMA was inconsistent over a large
	area of the graph space, no matter which distance was used. The simulation
	analysis showed how tree-making methods perform given limited numbers
	of character data. In some instances, the simulation results differed
	quantitatively from the consistency analysis. The consistency analysis
	indicated that Lake's method of invariants was consistent over all
	of the graph space under some conditions, whereas the simulation
	analysis showed that Lake's method of invariants performs poorly
	over most of the graph space for up to 500 variable characters. Parsimony,
	neighbor-joining, and the least-squares methods performed well under
	conditions of limited amount of character change and branch-length
	variation. By weighting the more slowly evolving characters or using
	distances that correct for multiple substitution events, the area
	in which tree-making methods are misleading can be reduced. Good
	performance at high rates of change was obtained only by giving increased
	weight to slowly evolving characters (e.g., transversion parsimony,
	weighted parsimony). UPGMA performed well only when branch lengths
	were close in length. [References: 39]},

  abstract = {Abstract. The nuclear small subunit rRNA (18S) has played a dominant
	role in the estimation of relationships among insect orders from
	molecular data. In previous studies, 18S sequences have been aligned
	by unadjusted automated approaches (computer alignments that are
	not manually readjusted), most recently with direct optimization
	(simultaneous alignment and tree building using a program called
	POY ). Parsimony has been the principal optimality criterion. Given
	the problems associated with the alignment of rRNA, and the recent
	availability of the doublet model for the analysis of covarying sites
	using Bayesian MCMC analysis, a different approach is called for
	in the analysis of these data. In this paper, nucleotide sequence
	data from the 18S small subunit rRNA gene of insects are aligned
	manually with reference to secondary structure, and analyzed under
	Bayesian phylogenetic methods with both GTR+I+G and doublet models
	in MrBayes. A credible phylogeny of Insecta is recovered that is
	independent of the morphological data and (unlike many other analyses
	of 18S in insects) not contradictory to traditional ideas of insect
	ordinal relationships based on morphology. Hexapoda, including Collembola,
	are monophyletic. Paraneoptera are the sister taxon to a monophyletic
	Holometabola but weakly supported. Ephemeroptera are supported as
	the sister taxon of Neoptera, and this result is interpreted with
	respect to the evolution of direct sperm transfer and the evolution
	of flight. Many other relationships are well-supported but several
	taxa remain problematic, e.g., there is virtually no support for
	relationships among orthopteroid orders. A website is made available
	that provides aligned 18S data in formats that include structural
	symbols and Nexus formats. [18S; alignment; doublet model; Insecta;

  abstract = {All inferences in comparative biology depend on accurate estimates
	of evolutionary relationships. Recent phylogenetic analyses have
	turned away from maximum parsimony towards the probabilistic techniques
	of maximum likelihood and bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (BMCMC).
	These probabilistic techniques represent a parametric approach to
	statistical phylogenetics, because their criterion for evaluating
	a topology -- the probability of the data, given the tree -- is calculated
	with reference to an explicit evolutionar y model from which the
	data are assumed to be identically distributed. Maximum parsimony
	can be con- sidered nonparametric, because trees are evaluated on
	the basis of a general metric -- the minimum number of character
	state changes required to generate the data on a given tree -- without
	assuming a specific distr ibution1. The shift to parametr ic methods
	was spurred, in large part, by studies showing that although both
	approaches perform well most of the time, maximum parsimony is strongly
	biased towards recovering an incorrect tree under certain combinations
	of branch lengths, whereas maximum likelihood is not. All these evaluations
	simulated sequences by a largely homogeneous evolutionary processin
	which data are identically distributed . There is ample evidence,
	however, that real-world gene sequences evolve heterogeneously and
	are not identically distributed. Here we show that maximum likelihood
	an dBMCMC can become strongly biased and statistically inconsistent
	when the rates at which sequence sites evolve change non-identically
	over time. Maximum parsimony performs substantially better than current
	parametric methods over a wide range of conditions tested, including
	moderate heterogeneity and phylogenetic problems not normally considered
	difficult. },

  abstract = {We determined the complete 14,985-nt sequence of the mitochondrial
	DNA of the horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus (Arthropoda: Xiphosura).
	This mtDNA encodes the 13 protein, 2 rRNA, and 22 tRNA genes typical
	for metazoans. The arrangement of these genes and about half of the
	sequence was reported previously; however, the sequence contained
	a large number of errors, which are corrected here. The two strands
	of Limulus mtDNA have significantly different nucleotide compositions.
	The strand encoding most mitochondrial proteins has 1.25 times as
	many A's as T's and 2.33 times as many C's as G's. This nucleotide
	bias correlates with the biases in amino acid content and synonymous
	codon usage in proteins encoded by different strands and with the
	number of non-Watson-Crick base pairs in the stem regions of encoded
	tRNAs. The sizes of most mitochondrial protein genes in Limulus are
	either identical to or slightly smaller than those of their Drosophila
	counterparts. The usage of the initiation and termination codons
	in these genes seems to follow patterns that are conserved among
	most arthropod and some other metazoan mitochondrial genomes. The
	noncoding region of Limulus mtDNA contains a potential stem-loop
	structure, and we found a similar structure in the noncoding region
	of the published mtDNA of the prostriate tick Ixodes hexagonus. A
	simulation study was designed to evaluate the significance of these
	secondary structures; it revealed that they are statistically significant.
	No significant, comparable structure can be identified for the metastriate
	ticks Rhipicephalus sanguineus and Boophilus microplus. The latter
	two animals also share a mitochondrial gene rearrangement and an
	unusual structure of mt-tRNA(C) that is exactly the same association
	of changes as previously reported for a group of lizards. This suggests
	that the changes observed are not independent and that the stem-loop
	structure found in the noncoding regions of Limulus and Ixodes mtDNA
	may play the same role as that between trnN and trnC in vertebrates,
	i.e., the role of lagging strand origin of replication.},

	showed that most changes in species composition followed changes

	mull to mor humus, with concomitant soil acidification, was observed
	with increasing elevation. It was observed that at a given elevation,
	changes in soil acidity occurring in the course of forest dynamics
	exerted the same effects than altitude, thus soil acidity explained
	better the composition of collembolan communities. Densities and
	local diversity of Collembola were observed to increase with soil
	acidity, which can be explained by (i) physiological adaptations
	to acid soils inherited from palaeozoic times and (ii) more habitat

	include the lack of computer algorithms that allow input of complex
	branched or reticulate character state trees and the inability to
	use polymorphisms as data in tree building and character optimization.
	The step matrix option in PAUP version 3.0 and MacClade versions
	2.1 and 3.0 provides a solution to these problems, allowing all homology
	information among character states to be utilized while retaining
	a biologically realistic definition of characters. For genetic data,
	this means that the locus can be coded as the character and allelic
	combinations can be coded as the character states. For ontogenetic
	data, this means that the entire ontogenetic sequence can be coded
	as the character and combinations of observed conditions within ontogenies
	can be coded as the character states. The unity of the locus or character
	ontogeny is preserved, and homology information from shared electrophoretic
	or ontogenetic conditions is not lost. Attention has not been called
	to the loss of homology information that accompanies coding the locus
	or an entire ontogeny as the character, possibly because of the lack
	of a coding option through which these data could be retained. The
	step matrix option allows any and all assumptions of transformation
	(order) among character states while retaining the unity of the locus
	or a whole ontogeny as the character and can be utilized for coding
	these and other polymorphic characters for phylogenetic analysis.

  abstract = { Relationships among the ecdysozoans, or molting animals, have been
	difficult to resolve. Here, we use nearly complete 28S + 18S ribosomal
	RNA gene sequences to estimate the relations of 35 ecdysozoan taxa,
	including newly obtained 28S sequences from 25 of these. The tree-building
	algorithms were likelihood-based Bayesian inference and minimum-evolution
	analysis of LogDet-trans- formed distances, and hypotheses were tested
	wth parametric bootstrapping. Better taxonomic resolution and recovery
	of estab- lished taxa were obtained here, especially with Bayesian
	inference, than in previous parsimony-based studies that used 18S
	rRNA sequences (or 18S plus small parts of 28S). In our gene trees,
	priapulan worms represent the basal ecdysozoans, followed by ne-
	matomorphs, or nematomorphs plus nematodes, followed by Panarthropoda.
	Panarthropoda was monophyletic with high support, although the relationships
	among its three phyla (arthropods, onychophorans, tardigrades) remain
	uncertain. The four groups of arthropods--hexapods (insects and related
	forms), crustaceans, chelicerates (spiders, scorpions, horseshoe
	crabs), and myriapods (centipedes, millipedes, and relatives)--formed
	two well-supported clades: Hexapoda in a paraphyletic crustacea (Pancrustacea),
	and ?Chelicerata + Myriapoda? (a clade that we name ?Paradoxopoda?).
	Pycnogonids (sea spiders) were either chelicerates or part of the
	?chelicerate + myriapod? clade, but not basal arthropods. Certain
	clades derived from morphological taxonomy, such as Mandib- ulata,
	Atelocerata, Schizoramia, Maxillopoda and Cycloneuralia, are inconsistent
	with these rRNA data. The 28S gene contained more signal than the
	18S gene, and contributed to the improved phylogenetic resolution.
	Our findings are similar to those obtained from mitochondrial and
	nuclear (e.g., elongation factor, RNA polymerase, Hox) protein-encoding
	genes, and should revive interest in using rRNA genes to study arthropod
	and ecdysozoan relationships. Keywords: Large-subunit ribosomal RNA;

	of insects evolve rapidly, so that close taxa differentiate or distant

	phylogeny reconstruction or evaluated against existing cladograms.
	Explicit statements regarding definition of alternative character
	states and direction of state change can trace evolution through
	hypothetical ancestors, establishing the most parsimonious explanation
	for observed data. Recent applications of these methods suggest that,
	when properly used and defined, ecological traits accurately reflect
	phylogeny. Some statistical methods aspire to factor out phylogenetic
	linkage from the correlation between traits, but such techniques
	are problematic. This review offers examples to demonstrate these
	general points and to stress the importance of a phylogenetic perspective
	in insect ecology. Specific issues examined within the cladistic
	framework include the phylogeny of insect\-host plant interactions

	pentastomids, and pycnogonids, have features characteristic of not
	only both major arthropod groups but also several other animal phyla,
	analysis of their phylogenetic positions may provide important clues
	for metazoan phylogeny in general. From analyses of complete or nearly
	complete 18S rDNA sequences, arthropod monophyly including all the
	traditional arthropod relatives was well supported. For detailed
	analyses within arthropods without outgroup effects, we made two
	reduced alignments. From the analyses of these reduced data sets,
	arthropods were divided into two clades: one was chelicerates and
	myriapods, whereas the other included crustaceans plus insects, onychophorans
	plus pentastomids, and tardigrades. The pycnogonids were grouped
	closely with the chelicerates. The Cambrian fossil record supports
	that myriapod-chelicerate and crustacean-insect (including tardigrades,
	onychophorans, and pentastomids) stems arose separately from a protoarthropod
	(perhaps nonarthropodized animal, such as a lobopod which has noncalcified
	cuticles, and nonjointed legs). Thus, the acquisition of truly arthropod
	characters occurred independently in the two stems. In this case,
	nonarthropodized characters of tardigrades, onychophorans, and pentastomids
	are assumed to be primitive.},

  abstract = {We present the complete 15,455-nt mitochondrial DNA sequence of the
	springtail Tetrodontophora bielanensis (Arthropoda, Hexapoda, Collembola).
	The gene content is typical of most metazoans, with 13 protein-coding
	genes (PCGs), 2 genes encoding for ribosomal RNA subunits, and 22
	tRNA genes. The nucleotide sequence shows the well-known A+T bias
	typical of insect mtDNA; its A+T content is lower (72.7%) than that
	observed in other insect species, but still higher than that in other
	arthropodan taxa. The bias appears to be uniform across the whole
	molecule, unlike other insect taxa, which show increased A+T content
	in the so-called A+T-rich region. However, the bias is slightly higher
	in the third codon positions of the PCGs (81.4%). Anomalous initiation
	codons have been observed in the nad2 and the cox1 genes. In the
	latter, the ATTTAA hexanucleotide is suggested to be involved in
	the initiation signaling. All tRNAs could be folded into the typical
	cloverleaf secondary structure, but the tRNA for cysteine appears
	to be missing the DHU arm. Long tandemly repeated regions (193 nt)
	were found in the A+T-rich region, which in turn was shown to have
	the possibility of forming a complex array of secondary structures.
	One of these structures encompassed the junction between the repeats.
	The A+T-rich region was also interesting in that it showed heteroplasmy
	in the number of repeats. Three haplotypes were found, possessing
	2, 3, and 4 identical repeats, respectively. The order of protein
	coding and rRNA genes in the molecule was determined and was identical
	to that of all insects studied so far. However, two tRNA translocations
	were found which were unprecedented among Arthropoda. These involved
	the trnQ, which was found between the rrnS and the A+T-rich region,
	and the trnS(ucn), which was located between trnM and trnI. A preliminary
	phylogenetic analysis based on the amino acid sequence of the PCGs
	failed to find support for the monophyly of Hexapoda.},

	our perception of the phylogenetic relationships among the main arthropod
	lineages: crustaceans, hexapods, chelicerates, and myriapods. Besides
	the intrinsic interest in unraveling the evolution of the largest
	animal phylum, these studies are basic to an understanding of one
	of the major transitions in animal evolution-i.e., the conquest of
	land with all its associated structural and functional adaptations.
	Myriapods have been traditionally considered the closest relatives
	of hexapods, thus implying only one origin of terrestriality for
	the tracheate lineage, but this view is now challenged by molecular
	evidence. Sequence data available to date for centipedes and millipedes
	are very limited, and the taxon sampling is strongly biased. The
	most critical gap was the scutigeromorph centipedes, which are the
	sister group to all remaining Chilopoda from which they probably
	diverged in the Silurian if not earlier. We obtained the first complete
	mitochondrial sequence for a representative of this clade, the house
	centipede. In our phylogenetic analyses of the protein-coding genes
	in this mitochondrial genome, along with 16 further ones representing
	the other major arthropod clades plus two outgroups, the myriapods
	formed a clade with the chelicerates. This implies that water-to-land
	transition occurred at least three times (hexapods, myriapods, arachnids)
	during the evolution of the Arthropoda. In addition, in contrast
	to all previous studies, our best supported topologies favor paraphyly
	of the myriapods with respect to the chelicerates. This would increase
	to four the main events of land colonization in arthropods (once
	for centipedes, once for millipedes).},

	of the natural system (sensu Griffiths, 1974, Acta Biotheor. 23:85-131;
	de Queiroz, 1988, Philos. Sci. 55:238-259). Just as maps are representations
	of the earth and are subject to what is called cartographic generalization,
	so diagrams of the natural system (evolutionary trees) are representations
	of the evolutionary chronicle and are subject to a temporal version
	of cartographic generalization, which may be termed systematic generalization.
	Cartographic generalization is based on judgements of geographical
	importance, and systematic generalization is based on judgements
	of historical importance, judgements expressed in narrative sentences
	(sensu Danto, 1985, Narration and knowledge, Columbia Univ Press,
	New York). At higher systematic levels, these narrative sentences
	are conventional and retrospective, but near the species level they
	become prospective, that is, dependent upon expectations of the future.
	The truth of prospective narrative sentences is logically indeterminable
	in the present, and since all the common species concepts depend
	upon prospective narration, it is impossible for any of them to be
	applied with precision.},

  abstract = {According to molecular sequence data Crustacea and not Myriapoda seem
	to be the sister-group to Insecta. This makes it necessary to reconsi-
	der how the morphology of their eyes ?t with these new cladograms.
	Homology of facetted eye structures in Insecta (Hexapoda in the sense
	of Ento- and Ectognatha) and Crustacea is clearly supported by identical
	numbers of cells in an ommatidium (two corneageneous or primary pig-
	ment cells, four Semper cells which build the crystalline cone and
	primarily eight retinula cells). These cell numbers are retained
	even when great functional modi?cation occurs, especially in the
	region of the dioptric apparatus. There are two di?erent possibilities
	to explain di?er- ences in eye structure in Myriapoda depending on
	their phylogenetic position in the cladogram of Mandibulata. In the
	traditional Tracheata cladogram, eyes of Myriapoda must be secondarily
	modi?ed. This modi?cation can be explained using the di?erent evolutionary
	pathways of insect facetted eyes to insect larval eyes (stemmata)
	as an analogous model system. Comparative morphology of larval insect
	eyes from all holometabolan orders shows that there are several evolutionary
	pathways which have led to di?erent types of stemmata and that the
	process always involved the breaking up the compound eye into individual
	larval ommatidia. Further evolution led on many occasions to so-called
	fusion-stemmata that occur convergently in each holometabolic order
	and reveals, in part, great structural similarities to the lateral
	ocelli of myriapods. As myriapodan eyes cannot be regarded as typical
	mandibulate ommatidia, their structure can be explained as a modi?ed
	complex eye evolved in a comparable way to the development to the
	fusion-stemmata of insect larvae. The facetted eyes of Scutigera
	(Myriapoda, Chilo- poda) must be considered as secondarily reorganized
	lateral myriapodan stemmata, the so-called `pseudo-compound eyes'.
	New is a crystalline cone-like vitreous body within the dioptric
	apparatus. In the new cladogram with Crustacea and Insecta as sister-groups
	however, the facetted eyes of Scutigera can be interpreted as an
	old precursor of the Crustacea ? Insecta facetted eye with modi?ed
	ommatidia having a four-part crystalline cone, etc. as a synapomorphy.
	Lateral ocelli of all the other Myriapoda are then modi?ed like insect
	stemmata. The precursor is then the Scutigera-Ommatidium. In addition
	further interpretations of evolutionary pathways of myriapodan morphological
	characters are dis- cussed. Key words: Facetted eye ? lateral ocelli
	? median eyes ? ommatidium ? stemmata ? larval eyes ? phylogeny of
	Arthropoda ? cladogram of Mandibulata ? Myriapoda ? Scutigera facetted

	in phylogenetic research. Pairwise and multiple alignment methods

	among all possible alignments, the one that satisfies the phylogenetic
	optimality criterion the best should be considered the best alignment.
	Since all homology statements are subject to testing and explanation
	this way, consistency of optimality criteria is desirable. This consistency
	is based on the treatment of alignment gaps as character information
	and the consistent use of a cost function (e.g., insertion deletion,
	transversion, and transition) through analysis from alignment to
	phylogeny reconstruction. Cost functions are not subject to testing
	via inspection; hence the assumptions they make should be examined
	by varying the assumed values in a sensitivity analysis context to
	test for the robustness of results. Agreement among data may be used
	to choose an optimal solution set from all of those examined through
	parameter variation. This idea of consistency between assumption
	and analysis through alignment and cladogram reconstruction is not

  journal = {BMC Biol.},
  year = {2004},
  volume = {19 },
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The earliest fossil evidence of terrestrial animal activity
	is from the Ordovician, 450 million years ago (Ma). However, there
	are earlier animal fossils, and most molecular clocks suggest a deep
	origin of animal phyla in the Precambrian, leaving open the possibility
	that animals colonized land much earlier than the Ordovician. To
	further investigate the time of colonization of land by animals,
	we sequenced two nuclear genes, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
	and enolase, in representative arthropods and conducted phylogenetic
	and molecular clock analyses of those and other available DNA and
	protein sequence data. To assess the robustness of animal molecular
	clocks, we estimated the deuterostome-arthropod divergence using
	the arthropod fossil record for calibration and tunicate instead
	of vertebrate sequences to represent Deuterostomia. Nine nuclear
	and 15 mitochondrial genes were used in phylogenetic analyses and
	61 genes were used in molecular clock analyses. RESULTS: Significant
	support was found for the unconventional pairing of myriapods (millipedes
	and centipedes) with chelicerates (spiders, scorpions, horseshoe
	crabs, etc.) using nuclear and mitochondrial genes. Our estimated
	time for the divergence of millipedes (Diplopoda) and centipedes
	(Chilopoda) was 442 +/- 50 Ma, and the divergence of insects and
	crustaceans was estimated as 666 +/- 58 Ma. Our results also agree
	with previous studies suggesting a deep divergence (~1100 - 900 Ma)
	for arthropods and deuterostomes, considerably predating the Cambrian
	Explosion seen in the animal fossil record. CONCLUSIONS: The consistent
	support for a close relationship between myriapods and chelicerates,
	using mitochondrial and nuclear genes and different methods of analysis,
	suggests that this unexpected result is not an artefact of analysis.
	We propose the name Myriochelata for this group of animals, which
	includes many that immobilize prey with venom. Our molecular clock
	analyses using arthropod fossil calibrations support earlier studies
	using vertebrate calibrations in finding that deuterostomes and arthropods
	diverged hundreds of millions of years before the Cambrian explosion.
	However, our molecular time estimate for the divergence of millipedes
	and centipedes is close to the divergence time inferred from fossils.
	This suggests that arthropods may have adapted to the terrestrial
	environment relatively late in their evolutionary history. },

	diversity of sperm transfer behaviors. Modes of sperm transfer can
	be categorized by the degree of contact between male and female during
	transfer, with direct transfer (copulation) involving the greatest
	contact, paired-indirect transfer an intermediate degree, and dissociated
	transfer the least. Internal fertilization, spermatophores, and copulation
	are sometimes assumed to have evolved after invasion of land, but
	all have evolved many times in the marine habitat. Behaviors associated
	with indirect sperm transfer include those having close parallels
	with direct transfer (provision of nuptial gifts) as well as unique
	phenomena (spermatophore trampling by rival males). The morphology
	and physiology of indirectly transferred spermatophores have been
	shaped by environmental factors (e.g. humidity) as well as biological
	ones (e.g. clutch size of females), and they may provide useful phylogenetic
	characters. Unanswered questions about indirect transfer include
	the following: Are females of dissociated species able to choose
	their partners? What determines size and number of spermatophores?
	Do speciation rates differ between taxa with direct versus indirect
	transfer?},

	2 (ITS2) of nuclear ribosomal DNA in combination with two plastid
	markers, trnL-F and psbT-H. In contrast to the widely used trnL-F
	region, the psbT-H gene cluster, coding for proteins of photosystem
	II, has been rarely used to address systematic questions among the
	different land plant lineages. To overcome the problem of potential
	ambiguous alignments of non-coding DNA regions, the data were independently
	analyzed using direct optimization. The comparison and evaluation
	of the obtained results showed that the inferred cladograms based
	on the different phylogenetic approaches are very similar, with only
	minor differences. In combination with morphological characters,
	generic relationships as well as taxonomic and nomenclatural problems,
	especially regarding the key genera Meteorium and Papillaria are
	discussed in detail. New insights into generic relationships of the
	Meteoriaceae are provided, such as the exclusion of the monospecific
	southern South American genera Ancistrodes and Cryphaeophilum, which
	are subsequently transferred to the Hookeriaceae and Cryphaeaceae,
	respectively. Phylogenetic reconstructions using maximum likelihood
	as well as parsimony approaches reveal that at the familial level
	the Meteoriaceae s. l. are polyphyletic, if the formerly recognized
	"Trachypodaceae" are considered as a separate family. Based on our
	results we favor the synonym of the Trachypodaceae with the Meteoriaceae.},

	using molecular sequence data derived from three nuclear genes: elongation
	factor-1\u03b1, RNA polymerase II, and elongation factor-2. Nucleotide
	and amino acids from 12 hexapods and 22 crustacean outgroups were
	analyzed using maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood methods.
	The results support most traditional morphology-based relationships,
	including monophyly of Hexapoda, Diplura, Insecta, and Pterygota.
	However, placement of Diplura was unstable. Some analyses placed
	them as the sister group to Ellipura (Collembola + Protura) to form
	Entognatha. In others, Diplura was recovered as the sister group
	to Insecta, contrary to the Entognatha hypothesis. The analysis also
	recovered a monophyletic Thysanura sensu lato (Archaeognatha + Zygentoma)
	as the sister group to Pterygota, a conclusion that is consistent
	with precladistic notions of hexapod systematics but conflicts with
	current understanding of morphological evolution. The data were also
	used to reconstruct divergence times from a Bayesian analysis of
	sequence changes that also incorporated constraints at several nodes
	based on our understanding of the fossil record. At one node that
	was not directly constrained by the fossil record (dictyopteran/orthopteroid
	divergence), our estimate was inconsistent with fossil evidence,
	suggesting our results (like those using other dating methods) should
	be interpreted with caution.},

	Onychiurus sinensis (Hexapoda). The attractiveness and selectivity
	of the ten fungi was investigated taken into account the effect of
	the substrate on which the fungus was growing (malt-agar or litter)
	and the effect of fungal odour. Furthermore, moulting, growth, survival
	and reproduction of O. sinensis in the presence of each of the ten
	test fungi were studied. Mucor plumbeus and Trichothecium roseum
	were the most preferred whatever the culture substrate and their
	odour was the most attractive. Two fungi (Penicillium spinulosum
	and the Basidiomycete S41) attracted Collembola by their odour but
	were not preferred as food sources. The animals could survive and
	reproduce on a mono-diet of several of our test fungi, but not on
	the Basidiomycete S41 and on Trichoderma polysporum. R?sum? Dix souches
	fongiques isol?es de la liti?re de chne vert (Quercus rotundifolia)

	gene that can be used to investigate recent divergences due to the
	presence of rapidly evolving introns. However, a universal feature
	of intron sequences is that even closely related species exhibit
	insertion and deletion events, which cause variation in the lengths
	of the sequences. Indels are frequently rich in evolutionary information,
	but most investigators ignore sites that fall within these variable
	regions, largely because the analytical tools and theory are not
	well developed. We examined this problem in the taxonomically problematic
	parasitoid wasp genus Pauesia (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Aphidiinae)
	using congruence as a criterion for assessing a range of methods
	for aligning such variable-length EF-1a intron sequences. These methods
	included distance- and parsimony-based multiple-alignment programs
	(CLUSTAL W and MALIGN), direct optimization (POY), and two ??by eye??
	alignment strategies. Furthermore, with one method (CLUSTAL W) we
	explored in detail the robustness of results to changes in the gap
	cost parameters. Pheneticbased alignments (??by eye?? and CLUSTAL
	W) appeared, under our criterion, to perform as well as more readily
	defensible, but computationally more demanding, methods. In general,
	all of our alignment and tree-building strategies recovered the same
	basic topological structure, which means that an underlying phylogenetic
	signal remained regardless of the strategy chosen. However, several
	relationships between clades were sensitive both to alignment and
	to tree-building protocol. Further alignments, considering only sequences
	belonging to the same group, allowed us to infer a range of phylogenetic
	relationships that were highly robust to tree-building protocol.
	By comparing these topologies with those obtained by varying the
	CLUSTAL parameters, we generated the distribution area of congruence
	and taxonomic compatibility. Finally, we present the first robust
	estimate of the European Pauesia phylogeny by using two EF-1a introns
	and 38 taxa (plus 3 outgroups). This estimate conflicts markedly
	with the traditional subgeneric classification. We recommend that
	this classification be abandoned, and we propose a series of monophyletic
	species groups.},

	either ''unordered'' or ''ordered'' in phylogenetic analyses using
	parsimony. Because ordering relations do not apply to the states
	of characters treated under these methods, I prefer ''maximally connected''
	character to ''unordered'' character and ''minimally connected''
	character to ''ordered'' character. This paper formally defines the
	two character types, compares their properties, and considers the
	consequences of the two methods for both resolution and congruence.
	The results demonstrate that minimally connected characters increase
	resolution relative to maximally connected characters. Minimally
	connected characters do not, however, necessarily increase congruence
	among data sets. Because both methods produce nonrandom congruence
	among data sets, both character types constitute valid phylogenetic
	methods. A mixed-parsimony approach is advocated, wherein multistate
	characters are treated as minimally connected whenever reasonable
	but treated as maximally connected otherwise. [References: 52]},

  abstract = {Partial 18S rRNA sequences of five chelicerate arthropods plus a crustacean,
	myriapod, insect, chordate, echinoderm, annelid, and platyhelminth
	were compared. The sequence data were used to infer phylogeny by
	using a maximum-parsimony method, an evolutionary-distance method,
	and the evolutionary-parsimony method. The phylogenetic inferences
	generated by maximum-parsimony and distance methods support both
	monophyly of the Arthropoda and monophyly of the Chelicerata within
	the Arthropoda. These results are congruent with phylogenies based
	on rigorous cladistic analyses of morphological characters. Results
	support the inclusion of the Arthropoda within a spiralian or protostome
	coelomate clade that is the sister group of a deuterostome clade,
	refuting the hypothesis that the arthropods represent the ``primitive''
	sister group of a protostome coelomate clade. Bootstrap analyses
	and consideration of all trees within 1 percent of the length of
	the most parsimonious tree suggest that relationships between the
	nonchelicerate arthropods and relationships within the chelicerate
	clade cannot be reliably inferred with the partial 18S rRNA sequence
	data. With the evolutionary-parsimony method, support for monophyly
	of the Arthropoda is found in the majority of the combinations analyzed
	if the coelomates are used as ``outgroups.'' Monophyly of the Chelicerata
	is supported in most combinations assessed. Our analyses also indicate
	that the evolutionary-parsimony method, like distance and parsimony,
	may be biased by taxa with long branches. We suggest that a previous
	study's inference of the Arthropoda as paraphyletic may be the result
	of (a) having two few arthropod taxa available for analysis and (b)
	including long-branched taxa.},

  abstract = {The order Diptera (true flies) is one of the most species-rich and
	ecologically diverse clades of insects. The order probably arose
	in the Permian, and the main lineages of flies were present in the
	Triassic. A novel recent proposal suggests that Strepsiptera are
	the sister-order to Diptera. Within Diptera, evidence is convincing
	for the monophyly of Culicomorpha, Blephariceromorpha, and Tipulomorpha
	but weak for the monophyly of the other basal infraorders and for
	the relationships among them. The lower Diptera (Nematocera) is paraphyletic
	with respect to Brachycera, and morphological evidence suggests the
	sister-group of Brachycera lies in the Psychodomorpha. Recent analyses
	suggest Tipulomorpha are closer to the base of Brachycera than to
	the base of Diptera. Brachycera are undoubtedly monophyletic, but
	relationships between the basal lineages of this group are poorly
	understood. The monophyly of Stratiomyomorpha, Xylophagomorpha, Tabanomorpha,
	and Muscomorpha is well supported. Eremoneura, and its constituent
	clades Empidoidea and Cyclorrhapha, are monophyletic. The sister-group
	of Eremoneura is likely to be part or all of Asiloidea. Several viewpoints
	on the homology of the male genitalia of eremoneuran flies are discussed.
	Phylogenetic analyses suggest that lower Cyclorrhapha (Aschiza) are
	paraphyletic; however, schizophoran monophyly is well supported.
	The monophyly of Acalyptratae is not well-founded and the relationships
	between acalyptrate superfamilies remain obscure. Recent advances
	document the monophyly of the families of Calyptratae and the relationships
	among them. Areas critical to future advances in understanding dipteran
	phylogeny include the relationships among the basal infraorders of
	Diptera and Brachycera and the relationships between the superfamilies
	of acalyptrates. Progress in dipteran phylogenetics will accelerate
	with the exploration of novel data sources and the formulation of
	hypotheses in an explicitly quantitative framework.},

	In order to investigate the phylogenetic relationship of F. langsethiae

	spacer (ITS) regions 1 and 2 and part of the intergenic spacer (IGS)
	region of the rDNA cluster and part of the [beta]-tubulin gene from
	109 strains of F. poae, F. sporotrichioides, F. langsethiae and Fusarium
	kyushuense from different geographic origin. Sequence analysis of
	ITS1 and 2 was unable to separate all F. sporotrichioides strains
	from F. langsethiae strains. Sequence analysis of [beta]-tubulin
	distinguished all four species, but it did not resolve the phylogenetic
	relationship between these two species. Sequence analysis of the
	IGS region distinguished the four species and led to a higher number
	of subgroups of the individual species, of which that of F. sporotrichioides
	var. minus isolates was even better supported than that of F. poae
	and F. langsethiae. Neighbor-joining and POY analyses of all combined
	sequences reliably separated all species studied, including F. langsethiae,
	clearly from F. sporotrichioides. The high intraspecific variability
	of the IGS sequences were found useful to group isolates according
	to their geographic origin. These results are in accordance with
	the results of the UP-PCR hybridization analysis. In summary, our
	data offer molecular support for the description of F. langsethiae
	as a new species in section Sporotrichiella.},

  abstract = {The phylogenetic relationship of Hexapoda has been debated for a long
	time, which will be resolved mainly depending on the settlement of
	monophyly, affinities and interrelationships among Protura, Collembola
	and Diplura. Mitochondrial 12sRNA gene about 355 bp fragments from
	one proturan species, two collembolan species, two dipluran species
	and one oribatid species were sequenced. The Kimura 2-parameter distances
	were calculated and a series of molecular phylogenetic trees were
	reconstructed by using the N-J method, from which the following points
	were drawn: Protura and Collembola compose a monophyletic group representing
	absent-cerci; Diplura is not a monophyletic group, in which Campodeoid
	with filiform cerci belongs to a clade and Japygoid with pincer cerci
	and Ectognatha compose another clade, that is, Insecta s. str. stemmed
	from Japygoid. So it would be suggested that the phylogenetic relationship
	of Hexapoda is [Parainsecta (Collembola + Protura) +Campodeoid +Insecta
	(Japygoid + Ectognatha)]. },

  abstract = {The inconsistency of the maximum-parsimony method for the case of
	five taxa with a molecular clock was studied using an analytical
	approach and Monte Carlo simulation. The inconsistency occurs in
	the case of a symmetrical tree with short internal branches and long
	external branches but can be avoided by using slowly evolving sequences.
	The neighbor-joining method is consistent if the evolutionary distances
	between taxa are estimated accurately. However, for short sequences,
	estimates of distances are subject to large statistical errors, and
	the probability of obtaining a certain erroneous tree by this method
	can be larger than the probability of obtaining the true tree. The
	implications for phylogenetic reconstruction are discussed. [References:
