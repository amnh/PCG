CamlPDF v0.3 Installation Instructions
======================================

1. Make sure zlib is on your path

2. Type "make all". (or "make bc" for just bytecode). Type "make top" if you
want an interactive top level.

3. Type "make -f examplesmake all" to build the examples

4. Type "./pdfhello" to build hello.pdf in the same directory. If this works,
CamlPDF works.

5. Type "make documents" to build the documentation in doc/camlpdf/html using
ocamldoc

6. Type "make literate litfinish" to build the literate program. (Requires
ocamlweb, GNU textutils, modern latex installation with memoir class).

(Windows Native Toolchain users please note: this is a mixed C/Ocaml library,
which isn't supported under this toolchain: You'll need to compile it
differently)
