/* 
 * In Sankoff characters, the metric can actually make no sense at all, so we
 * can't assume much about the properties of the transformation cost matrix. 
 * We can actually evaluate several parameters from this matrix to improve the
 * computational cost (for example, if the transformation cost matrix is
 * actually a constant, we can treat them as non-additive characters!);
 * In this version of the function, no assumptions can be done; all we know is
 * that the intermediate and the cost between states has been precomputed in a
 * transformation cost matrix that can be easily handled using the cm library. 
 * So here are the functions needed. 
 * When a certain pair of children characters are to be evaluated, the cost of
 * each possible state for the character should be calculated. This function
 * stores the cost of each of the possible combinations. The ss in the function
 * means 'single character' as it should be applied on each chraracter at a
 * time. This is the slowest version of sankoff character state calculation
 * (from the precomputed set).
 * @param a_sz The cardinality of the state set.
 * @param ch1 An array with the cost of each of the possible states in the first
 * child of p.
 * @param ch2 An array with the cost of each of the possible states in the
 * second child of p.
 * @param p The parent of ch1 and ch2. Its contents are to be modified.
 * @param tcm A pointer to the precalculated transformation cost matrix for the
 * possible states of the character.
 * @return The total cost of the best possible transformation from ch1 to ch2.
 *
 * Brief Description of the algorithm:
 * 1. Initialize the costs to a large value */
/* 2. For each state in p, each state in ch1 and each state in ch2 */
/* 3. If a better cost is found, then store it. */
