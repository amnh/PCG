''' super-commit.py solves two problems:
    1. a nested git directory (the child) needs to be committed to
       two git reposâ€”one in prototype for an external developer and one in production for in-house use;
    2. in addition the files in the prototype subdirectory need to be synced with the files in production.


    Takes a single argv, a string, which is the commit message. Checks which directory it's run from,
    commits in that directory and also the other (could be parent or child). Directory paths are
    relative, in that the complete directory path is machine-independent, but absolute in that the
    relation between the parent and child directories is hard-coded.
